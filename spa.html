                    <p>Touch is healing; from a motherâ€™s touch which comforts and soothes her baby to the triumphant athlete patted on the back by fellow athletes. 
                    Based on the same principle as human touch, massage is the oldest method of promoting good health, suppleness and strength.
                    Today, the role of massage therapy is recognized by the general public and other health care professionals as being an effective health care alternative. 
                    Due to public perception and desire, massage therapy has grown into a more prominent position. It is a viable and respected profession promoting good health not only for your physical but emotional well being also.
                     Massage Therapy is the kneading, manipulation or application of methodical pressure and friction of the body. Whether it is for treatment of injury, stress or for relaxation, the skilled use of
                     massage through touch is used to maintain and enhance the health and well being of the entire body. Experience the benefits massage can offer you.</p>

                     <br>
                       <p>It is very rare that one of our Spa Professionals gets sick or has a family emergency 
                        and we understand it is extremely disappointing to not have the treatment you requested. 
                        Staff will make every effort in finding an alternative time in the day or during your stay with another therapist,
                         sometimes involving a slightly different Treatment. </p>
                         <br>
                         <p>We appreciate our guests for being so patient during these unforeseen 
                         circumstances. Currently if there is a cancellation and you cannot be accommodated, there will be no Spa charge to your room.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                        <br>
                        <p>The Policy change allows us not only to make sure there is no out of pocket expense (the cost of the treatment) 
                        but that we will also compensate you beyond what the Couples Resort could not provide you.
