                     <br>
                       <p>It is very rare that one of our Spa Professionals gets sick or has a family emergency 
                        and we understand it is extremely disappointing to not have the treatment you requested. 
                        Staff will make every effort in finding an alternative time in the day or during your stay with another therapist,
                         sometimes involving a slightly different Treatment. </p>

                         <p>We appreciate our guests for being so patient during these unforeseen 
                         circumstances. Currently if there is a cancellation and you cannot be accommodated, there will be no Spa charge to your room.
